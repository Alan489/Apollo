# Apollo
## Abstract
Welcome to Apollo!
This passion project was created for the sole purpose of expanding the capabilities of the Hoboken Volunteer Ambulance Corps. Mostly dispatched by our Police Department, there are days, such as bar crawls and holidays, when the ambulance corps utilizes "FieldComm" for better communication between our units, supervisors, and our own dispatchers.
Apollo is a modern expansion on the open source-PHP based **[Blackflower CAD](https://github.com/PhirePhly/blackflower)**, giving a modern look and feel, as well as utilizing a modern Blazor framework instead of PHP5
